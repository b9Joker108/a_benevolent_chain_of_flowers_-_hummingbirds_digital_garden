# About This Digital Garden

Welcome to my digital garden! This is a space where I cultivate thoughts, nurture ideas, and watch knowledge bloom.

## About Me

I'm Beauford A. Stenberg, and this garden is my personal knowledge repository and thinking space.

## How to Navigate

This digital garden is organized into three main areas:

- **Seeds** - New and developing ideas
- **Notes** - Established knowledge and learning
- **Thoughts** - Personal reflections and insights

Feel free to explore, wander, and discover connections between different pieces of knowledge.

## Philosophy

Like a physical garden:
- Some areas are well-tended, others are wild
- Ideas are interconnected and influence each other
- Growth happens over time, not all at once
- There's beauty in the process, not just the final product

## Get in Touch

This garden is open for visitors. If you'd like to connect or have thoughts to share, feel free to reach out through GitHub.
