# üå∏ A Benevolent Chain of Flowers - Hummingbirds Digital Garden

Beauford A. Stenberg's digital garden - a living, evolving collection of thoughts, notes, and ideas.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a place where knowledge grows organically. Unlike traditional blogs with chronological posts, digital gardens are:

- **Living documents** - constantly updated and refined
- **Interconnected** - ideas link together forming a knowledge web
- **Exploratory** - embracing works-in-progress and incomplete thoughts

## Structure

This garden is organized into three main areas:

### üå± Seeds
Fresh ideas and early-stage thoughts - raw concepts just beginning to sprout.

### üìù Notes
More developed ideas and learning notes - concepts that have been tended and are growing.

### üí≠ Thoughts
Reflections, musings, and personal insights - the flowers of the garden.

Like a physical garden:
