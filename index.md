# 🌸 Welcome to Beauford A. Stenberg's Digital Garden

A benevolent chain of flowers - where thoughts bloom and ideas take flight like hummingbirds.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a place where ideas grow organically. Unlike a traditional blog where posts are polished and published chronologically, a digital garden is:

- **Living and evolving** - notes and thoughts are continuously updated and refined
- **Interconnected** - ideas link to each other, creating a web of knowledge
- **Work in progress** - not everything is perfectly polished, and that's okay

*"The glory of gardening: hands in the dirt, head in the sun, heart with nature. To nurture a garden is to feed not just the body, but the soul."*
