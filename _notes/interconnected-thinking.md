# The Power of Interconnected Thinking

Our brains don't work in isolationâ€”they make connections between disparate ideas. A digital garden mirrors this natural process.

## Why Links Matter

When we connect ideas:
- We see patterns we might have missed
- We create new insights from existing knowledge
- We build a personal web of understanding

## Example: Biology meets Design

The branching patterns in trees (dendritic growth) inspire:
- Network architecture
- Organizational structures
- Information flow design

## Practice

Try finding three unexpected connections between different notes in your garden. What new insights emerge?
