# Welcome to Digital Gardens

A digital garden is more than just a blogâ€”it's a living, breathing ecosystem of ideas.

## Key Principles

1. **Growth Over Perfection** - Ideas don't need to be complete to be shared
2. **Interconnection** - Link ideas together to create a web of knowledge
3. **Continuous Cultivation** - Return to notes and refine them over time
4. **Public Learning** - Share your learning journey openly

## Getting Started

Start small:
- Create a seed for a new idea
- Link it to related concepts
- Nurture it over time
- Watch it grow into a fuller note

## Resources

- Books on note-taking and knowledge management
- Other digital gardens for inspiration
- Tools like Obsidian, Notion, or Roam Research
